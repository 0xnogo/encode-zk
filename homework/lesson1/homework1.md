# Homework - lesson 1

## Maths Introduction

```
1. Working with the following set of Integers S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}
```

What is
1. 4 + 4
    * 4 + 4 mod 7 = 1
2. 3 x 5
    * 3 x 5 mod 7 = 15 mod 7 = 1
3. What is the inverse of 3?
    * 3^-1 mod 7 = 5 (using the Fermat's little problem a^-1 = a^p-2 mod p)

```
2. For S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, can we consider S and the operation + to be a group?
```

A group is a set of elements plus a binary operation, here the addition.

A set needs to follow these properties:
1. Closure
2. Associativity
3. Identity element (= 0)
4. Inverse element

`S` is a group

```
3. What is -13 mod 5?
```
-13 mod 5 = 2

Mod cannot be negative

## Use cases

```
Think of some use cases of ZKP. What problems are there when using zkps in real world situation?
```

Use cases:
* Proof we pay tax to the tax authority without sharing bank receipt.
* Proof that we own an asset without sharing any document (Notarial for a real estate sell)
* Prove that renter has enough income to rent an appartement without sharing his payslips.

Usually we have to communicate with some central authorities.
